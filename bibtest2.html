<h2 class="passageref">Mark 1:1-12</h2>
<div class="bibletext">
<p>
<p><span class="cc vnumVis">1</span>The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
<p><sup class="ww vnumVis">2</sup>As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, <blockquote>“See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you,<br/><spacer size="10"/>who will prepare your way;<br/>
<sup class="ww vnumVis">3</sup>the voice of one crying out in the wilderness:<br/><spacer size="10"/>‘Prepare the way of the Lord,<br/><spacer size="10"/>make his paths straight,’”</blockquote>
<sup class="ww vnumVis">4</sup>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">5</sup>And people from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were going out to him, and were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">6</sup>Now John was clothed with camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">7</sup>He proclaimed, “The one who is more powerful than I is coming after me; I am not worthy to stoop down and untie the thong of his sandals.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">8</sup>I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
<p><sup class="ww vnumVis">9</sup>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">10</sup>And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">11</sup>And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”
<sup class="ww vnumVis">12</sup>And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.
