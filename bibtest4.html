<h2 class="passageref">Exodus 32:21-34</h2>
<div class="bibletext">
<p>
<p><sup class="ww vnumVis">21</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”
<sup class="ww vnumVis">22</sup>And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are bent on evil.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">23</sup>They said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’
<sup class="ww vnumVis">24</sup>So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”
<sup class="ww vnumVis">25</sup>When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them run wild, to the derision of their enemies),
<sup class="ww vnumVis">26</sup>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the Lord’s side? Come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">27</sup>He said to them, “Thus says the <span class="sc">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.’“
<sup class="ww vnumVis">28</sup>The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the people fell on that day.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">29</sup>Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the <span class="sc">Lord</span>, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing on yourselves this day.”
<p><sup class="ww vnumVis">30</sup>On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. But now I will go up to the <span class="sc">Lord</span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
<sup class="ww vnumVis">31</sup>So Moses returned to the <span class="sc">Lord</span> and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">32</sup>But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written.”
<sup class="ww vnumVis">33</sup>But the <span class="sc">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
<sup class="ww vnumVis">34</sup>But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes for punishment, I will punish them for their sin.”
