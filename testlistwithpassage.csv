<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">3</sup>And you shall speak to all who have ability, whom I have endowed with skill, that they make Aaron’s vestments to consecrate him for my priesthood.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">4</sup>These are the vestments that they shall make: a breastpiece, an ephod, a robe, a checkered tunic, a turban, and a sash. When they make these sacred vestments for your brother Aaron and his sons to serve me as priests,

<p><span class=""cc vnumVis"">32</span>When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, the people gathered around Aaron, and said to him, “Come, make gods for us, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">2</sup>Aaron said to them, “Take off the gold rings that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters, and bring them to me.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">3</sup>So all the people took off the gold rings from their ears, and brought them to Aaron.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">4</sup>He took the gold from them, formed it in a mold, and cast an image of a calf; and they said, “These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">5</sup>When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation and said, “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">6</sup>They rose early the next day, and offered burnt offerings and brought sacrifices of well-being; and the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to revel.
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">7</sup>The <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go down at once! Your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have acted perversely;
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">8</sup>they have been quick to turn aside from the way that I commanded them; they have cast for themselves an image of a calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt!&lt;
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">9</sup>The <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I have seen this people, how stiff-necked they are.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">10</sup>Now let me alone, so that my wrath may burn hot against them and I may consume them; and of you I will make a great nation.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">11</sup>But Moses implored the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> his God, and said, “O <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>, why does your wrath burn hot against your people, whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">12</sup>Why should the Egyptians say, ‘It was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce wrath; change your mind and do not bring disaster on your people.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">13</sup>Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants, how you swore to them by your own self, saying to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants like the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have promised I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’“
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">14</sup>And the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> changed his mind about the disaster that he planned to bring on his people.
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">15</sup>Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain, carrying the two tablets of the covenant in his hands, tablets that were written on both sides, written on the front and on the back.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">16</sup>The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, engraved upon the tablets.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">17</sup>When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a noise of war in the camp.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">18</sup>But he said, “It is not the sound made by victors, or the sound made by losers; it is the sound of revelers that I hear.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">19</sup>As soon as he came near the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses’ anger burned hot, and he threw the tablets from his hands and broke them at the foot of the mountain.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">20</sup>He took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, ground it to powder, scattered it on the water, and made the Israelites drink it.

<p>
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">21</sup>Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you that you have brought so great a sin upon them?”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">22</sup>And Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn hot; you know the people, that they are bent on evil.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">23</sup>They said to me, ‘Make us gods, who shall go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">24</sup>So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off’; so they gave it to me, and I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf!”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">25</sup>When Moses saw that the people were running wild (for Aaron had let them run wild, to the derision of their enemies),
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">26</sup>then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Who is on the Lord’s side? Come to me!” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">27</sup>He said to them, “Thus says the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>, the God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side, each of you! Go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill your brother, your friend, and your neighbor.’“
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">28</sup>The sons of Levi did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand of the people fell on that day.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">29</sup>Moses said, “Today you have ordained yourselves for the service of the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>, each one at the cost of a son or a brother, and so have brought a blessing on yourselves this day.”
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">30</sup>On the next day Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. But now I will go up to the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">31</sup>So Moses returned to the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> and said, “Alas, this people has sinned a great sin; they have made for themselves gods of gold.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">32</sup>But now, if you will only forgive their sin—but if not, blot me out of the book that you have written.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">33</sup>But the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against me I will blot out of my book.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">34</sup>But now go, lead the people to the place about which I have spoken to you; see, my angel shall go in front of you. Nevertheless, when the day comes for punishment, I will punish them for their sin.”

<p>
<p><span class=""cc vnumVis"">33</span>The <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> said to Moses, “Go, leave this place, you and the people whom you have brought up out of the land of Egypt, and go to the land of which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">2</sup>I will send an angel before you, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">3</sup>Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey; but I will not go up among you, or I would consume you on the way, for you are a stiff-necked people.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">4</sup>When the people heard these harsh words, they mourned, and no one put on ornaments.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">5</sup>For the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> had said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single moment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now take off your ornaments, and I will decide what to do to you.’“
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">6</sup>Therefore the Israelites stripped themselves of their ornaments, from Mount Horeb onward.
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">7</sup>Now Moses used to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, far off from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. And everyone who sought the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> would go out to the tent of meeting, which was outside the camp.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">8</sup>Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each of them, at the entrance of their tents and watch Moses until he had gone into the tent.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">9</sup>When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the entrance of the tent, and the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> would speak with Moses.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">10</sup>When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, all the people would rise and bow down, all of them, at the entrance of their tent.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">11</sup>Thus the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> used to speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Then he would return to the camp; but his young assistant, Joshua son of Nun, would not leave the tent.
<p><sup class=""ww vnumVis"">12</sup>Moses said to the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>, “See, you have said to me, ‘Bring up this people’; but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.’
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">13</sup>Now if I have found favor in your sight, show me your ways, so that I may know you and find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">14</sup>He said, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">15</sup>And he said to him, “If your presence will not go, do not carry us up from here.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">16</sup>For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people, unless you go with us? In this way, we shall be distinct, I and your people, from every people on the face of the earth.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">17</sup>The <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">18</sup>Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">19</sup>And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The <span class=""sc"">Lord</span>’; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy.
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">20</sup>But,” he said, “you cannot see my face; for no one shall see me and live.”
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">21</sup>And the <span class=""sc"">Lord</span> continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock;
<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">22</sup>and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by;

<sup class=""ww vnumVis"">9</sup>He said, “If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, I pray, let the Lord go with us. Although this is a stiff-necked people, pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.”
