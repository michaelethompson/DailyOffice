Ezekiel 36:22-27
<div class="bibletext">\n<p>\n<sup class="ww vnumVis">22</sup>Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord <span class="sc">God</span>: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.\n<sup class="ww vnumVis">23</sup>I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them; and the nations shall know that I am the <span class="sc">Lord</span>, says the Lord <span class="sc">God</span>, when through you I display my holiness before their eyes.\n<sup class="ww vnumVis">24</sup>I will take you from the nations, and gather you from all the countries, and bring you into your own land.\n<p><sup class="ww vnumVis">25</sup>I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleannesses, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.\n<sup class="ww vnumVis">26</sup>A new heart I will give you, and a new spirit I will put within you; and I will remove from your body the heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.\n<sup class="ww vnumVis">27</sup>I will put my spirit within you, and make you follow my statutes and be careful to observe my ordinances.\n</p>\n</p></div>
